## Protecting the data

### Personal data

Identify the data that is personal and the data that is not personal. Personal data is **any information that can be used to identify an individual**. This includes names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and social security numbers. Non-personal data is any information that cannot be used to identify an individual. This includes data that is aggregated or anonymized.

### Anonymize the data

Anonymize the data before sharing it with others. Anonymization is the process of removing personal information from the data so that it cannot be used to identify an individual. This includes removing names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and social security numbers. It also includes **aggregating the data** so that it cannot be used to identify an individual.

### RGPD (General Data Protection Regulation)

Apply the RGPD to **all personal data that is collected, processed, or stored**. The RGPD is a regulation that protects the personal data of individuals in the **European Union**. It requires **organizations** to obtain consent before collecting personal data, to store personal data securely, and to delete personal data when it is no longer needed.

## Applying the law

Design the system to comply with the law. This includes **identifying the data that is personal**, **applying the RGPD to personal data**, and **protecting personal data**. It also includes **obtaining consent** before collecting personal data, **storing personal data securely**, and **deleting personal data when it is no longer needed**.

**`Privacy by design`** is a principle that requires organizations to design their systems with privacy in mind. This includes **identifying the data that is personal**, **applying the RGPD to personal data**, and **protecting personal data**. It also includes **obtaining consent** before collecting personal data, **storing personal data securely**, and **deleting personal data when it is no longer needed**.

## Sanctions

Applied not to individual but to society. The **sanctions** are applied to organizations that do not comply with the law. This includes **fines**, **warnings**, and **injunctions**. The **fines** are based on the severity of the violation and the size of the organization. The **warnings** are issued to organizations that are not in compliance with the law. The **injunctions** are orders to stop collecting, processing, or storing personal data.
