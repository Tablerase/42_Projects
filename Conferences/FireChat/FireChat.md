Investor want to multiply their investment by 10. They want to see the project grow and to be able to sell their shares at a higher price. With usually a 10 years horizon.
They want to see the project grow and be able to reach a hight valuation. So you need to show them that you can reach that valuation or that you can make them reach it.

Human aspect to create the hype around your project. Find the main investors to make the others follow.

At a certain point, you will ask the investors what they can bring to your project and not the opposite. That will make them more interested in your project and add FOMO.
