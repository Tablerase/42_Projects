# Start up in GenAI world

- Always start with a problem, not a solution
- Try to sell an idea (POC) that solve a customer problem before you build it (MVP - Minimum Viable Product) - Product Management 101

- Don't be afraid to fail 
  - Fail **fast**, fail **often**
  - Fail **cheap**

- genAI models: 
  - **Data** is the most important part of AI models
  - **Model** is the second most important part of AI models
  - **Algorithm** is the least important part of AI models

- Be prepared to change your model often (every 2-3 months) - AI models are not static (they are dynamic)

- Most important is to **hook** the client to your product
  - **Hook** = **Value** + **Ease of Use** + **Reward** + **Investment**
  - the client doesnt care about the technology, they care about the value you bring to them

- **AI** is not a product, it is a **feature** of a product
