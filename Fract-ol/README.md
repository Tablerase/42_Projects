# Fract-ol

The term fractal was first used by mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot in 1974. 

He based it on the Latin word fractus which means "broken" or "fractured".

A fractal is an abstract mathematical object, like a curve or a surface, which pattern
remains the same at every scale.

Various natural phenomena â€“ like the romanesco cabbage â€“ have some fractal features.
