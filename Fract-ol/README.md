# Fract-ol

The term fractal was first used by mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot in 1974. 

He based it on the Latin word fractus which means "broken" or "fractured".

A fractal is an abstract mathematical object, like a curve or a surface, which pattern
remains the same at every scale.

Various natural phenomena – like the romanesco cabbage – have some fractal features.

### Julia Set

Julia sets: $\ Z_{n + 1} = Z_n + c$

$\ Z = a + bi$ where **a** and **b** => represent x and y axis.

$\ Z$ is repeatedly updated using:  $\ Z = Z^2 + c$  where $\ c$ is another complex number that gives a specific Julia set.

After numerous iterations, if the **magnitude** of $\ Z$ is less than **2** we say that pixel is in the Julia set and color it accordingly. Performing this calculation for a whole grid of pixels gives a fractal image.

### Mandelbrot Set

Mandelbrot set is generated by iterating a simple function on the points of the complex plane. The points that produce a cycle (the same value over and over again) fall in the set, whereas the points that diverge (give ever-growing values) lie outside it.

The **initial value** of  **$\ Z$ is always 0**, and the **constant  c** is determined by the **coordinates of the point in the complex plane** being considered.

$
Z = Z^2 + c
$

$
Z_{n+1} = {Z_{n}}^2 + c
$

The set iterate from $\ n = 0$ to $\ n_{MaxIteration}$ and does not diverge out of the bounded in absolute value.

$\ c $ is a complexe number : $\ c = a + bi$, $\ a$ reel part and $\ bi$ imaginary part. that complexe number is determined with coordinates in the complex plane.

$\ Z = (a + bi)^2 + c$

$\ Z = a^2 + 2abi + b^2i^2 + c$ Taking into account: $\ i^2 = -1$

$\ Z = a^2 + 2abi - b^2 + c$

For code purpose:

$\ aa = a^2 - b^2$

$\ bb = 2 * a * b$

$\ Z = aa + bb + c$

To adjust: c = scale + offset

$\ a = aa + c_x$ with $\ c_x = (x - \frac{WIDTH}{2.0}) + \frac{4.0}{HEIGHT}$

$\ b = bb + c_y$ with $\ c_y = (y - \frac{HEIGHT}{2.0}) + \frac{4.0}{WIDTH}$

If magnitude $\ Z = a + b$ diverge out of bound (> 4), the set diverge else it converge. Display the set accordingly.

To center content/ offset with $\ c$ :

- x and y are the pixel coordinates in the display. WIDTH and HEIGHT are the dimensions of your display area. The `(x - WIDTH / 2.0)` and `(y - HEIGHT / 2.0)` parts **shift the coordinate system so that the center** of your display corresponds to (0, 0) in the complex plane.
- The multiplication by `4.0 / WIDTH` and `4.0 / HEIGHT` **scales the coordinates** so that you are looking at a region that **spans -2 to 2** (both in real and imaginary parts) in the complex plane. This scaling factor of 4.0 is somewhat arbitrary and **can be adjusted based on your preferences to zoom in or out** of the Mandelbrot set.

### Math

#### Complexe Number

🔗 [Details](https://brilliant.org/wiki/complex-numbers/)

<img src="./Media/Veen-diagram.png" align="right">

A complex number is a number that can be written in the form $\ a+bi$, where **a** and **b** are **real numbers** and **i** is the **imaginary unit** defined by $\ i^2=−1 $.

The set of complex numbers, denoted by $\mathbb{C}$ , includes the set of real numbers $\mathbb{R}$ and the set of pure imaginary numbers.

Based on the nature of the real part and imaginary part, any complex number can be classified into four types:

- imaginary number
- zero complex number
- purely imaginary number
- purely real number.

For $\ Z=a+ib$, the following four cases arise:

1. If $\ a = 0$ and $\ b \neq 0$, then $\ Z$ is an imaginary number.
2. If $\ a = 0$ and $\ b = 0$, then $\ Z$ is a zero complex number.
3. If $\ a \neq 0$ and $\ b = 0$, then $\ Z$ is a purely real number.
4. If $\ a \neq 0$ and $\ b \neq 0$, then $\ Z$ is a complex number.

**Every real number is a complex number, but every complex number is not necessarily a real number.**

The set of all complex numbers is denoted by $\ Z ∈ \mathbb{C} $. The set of all imaginary numbers is denoted as $\ Z ∈ \mathbb{C−R} $.

#### Magnitude

<img src="https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/images/vector-mag-dir.svg" align="right">

The magnitude of a number (also called its absolute value) is its distance from zero, so

- the magnitude of 6 is 6
- the magnitude of −6 is also 6

The magnitude of a vector is its length (ignoring direction).

For a complex number $\ Z = a + bi$, we define the magnitude, $\ |Z|$, as
follows:

$ |Z| = \sqrt{a2 + b2} $
