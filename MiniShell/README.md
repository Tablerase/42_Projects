### Infos

`readline()` can cause some leaks, it's a known issue, no need to worry about it.

### Mandatory

Needed to be able to do:

- Show a prompt when waiting for a new command
- Working **History**
- Working with absolute and relative path to execute a command
- One global variable: to handle the received signal
- Handle single quotes `'` (prevent interpretation of meta characters)
- Handle double quotes `"` (prevent interpretation of meta characters except for `$`)
- Handle **redirections**:
  - `<` redirect input
  - `>` redirect output
  - `<<` takes a `delimiter` and redirect input in a `heredoc` fashion until the delimiter is found. (Doesnt need an history)
  - `>>` redirect output with `append mode`
- Handle pipes `|`
- Handle **environment variables** `$`(followed by a sequence of characters) : `$PATH`, `$HOME`, `$USER`, `$PWD` etc... (See `man environ` for more informations)
- Handle exit status `$?`
- Handle signals:
  - `ctrl-C`: display a new prompt on a newline
  - `ctrl-D`: exit the shell
  - `ctrl-\`: do nothing
- Handle builtins:
  - `echo` with option `-n`
  - `cd` with only a relative or absolute path
  - `pwd` without any options
  - `export` without any options
  - `unset` without any options
  - `env` without any options and any arguments
  - `exit` without any options
