## Definition

CI/CD is a method to frequently deliver apps to customers by introducing automation into the stages of app development. The main concepts attributed to CI/CD are continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment.

### CI/CD Pipeline

A CI/CD pipeline automates the steps required to deliver the code changes to the customers. The pipeline builds code, runs tests (CI), and safely deploys a new version of the application (CD). The CI/CD pipeline is a set of tools that help to automate the software delivery process.

### Continuous Integration

Continuous Integration is the practice of automating the integration of code changes from multiple contributors into a single software project. The CI process is comprised of automatic tools that assert the new code’s correctness before integration. As such, the main goal of CI is to prevent integration problems, referred to as “integration hell,” which usually happens when members of a team integrate their changes too infrequently.

### Continuous Delivery

Continuous Delivery is the practice of keeping code in a deployable state. The main idea behind CD is to automate the software delivery process. CD aims to build, test, and release software with greater speed and frequency.

### Continuous Deployment

Continuous Deployment is the practice of automatically deploying code changes to production. The main goal of Continuous Deployment is to release software to customers as quickly as possible. CD is the natural evolution of Continuous Delivery, where every change that passes all stages of production is released to customers.
