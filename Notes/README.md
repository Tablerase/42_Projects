# Notes

## Makefile

Make:

- -C `/path/to/directory` :
  - make changes to the directory /path/to/directory before it starts reading the makefiles. This is useful when you want to build a project that resides in a different directory, but you're currently in a different directory.

Shell commands:

To run the **shell** command, it has to be within the brackets and prefixed with shell. Example: `$(shell uname)`
