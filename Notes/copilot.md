- Main: JS, Python, Java

Training of AI on Database: so more used language will have more readyness in the model.

Response with context of files and your prompts

Copilot return to u norms and suggestions adapts to your code with your use.

Gain in repetitive task.

The more complexity you need the less useful AI can help.

You need to have coding base in algorithmic.

## Features

- Completion auto on recuring code

- Data for Copilot AI suggestions:
  - your habitude of code
  - the context of the file. Objectif: soon -> The whole project (beta).

## Example

Demo with open source api and insertion of the data on a webpage.

IDE: JetBrains -> extension Copilot
