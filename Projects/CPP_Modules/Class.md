## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

In object-oriented programming (often abbreviated as OOP), the focus is on creating program-defined data types that contain both properties and a set of well-defined behaviors. The term “object” in OOP refers to the objects that we can instantiate from such types.

Help to manage complexity in large programs by grouping related data and functions together.

Modularity is achieved by creating classes that can be reused in other programs. This eliminates the need to rewrite the same code over and over again.

OOB concepts:
  - Encapsulation
  - Inheritance
  - Abstraction
  - Polymorphism
