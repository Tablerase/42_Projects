## Checks during correction

- To quickly check for forbidden keywords, use `grep` with the following options:
  - `-r` (or `--recursive`) option to search through a directory and its subdirectories. 
  - To exclude binary files, use the `-I` option which tells `grep` to ignore binary files.

```bash
grep -rI "*alloc"
grep -rI "free"
grep -rI "*printf"
grep -rI "friend"
```

### [BSP](../../../Notes/binary_space_partitioning.md)

BSP conrespond to Binary Space Partitioning. It is a method used to divide a space into two parts.
In the context of video games, it is used to divide a map into two parts, to optimize the rendering of the map.

#### Exercice Problem

<img src="./Media/findPointinTriangle.svg" title="Graph of Triangles and Point to check">

Find if a point is inside a triangle.

#### Exercice Solution

Possible way to solve (but this solutions **doesnt really use BSP**):

- Use the area of the triangle to determine if the point is inside the triangle.
  - Calculate the area of the triangle
  $$A = \left|\frac{x1\times (y2 - y3) + x2 \times (y3 - y1) + x3 \times (y1 - y2)}{2}\right| $$
  - Calculate the area of the three triangles formed by the point and the three points of the triangle
  - If the sum of the three areas is equal to the area of the triangle, the point is inside the triangle.

- Use the direction of the vectors to determine if the point is inside the triangle.
  - Calculate the vectors of the three sides of the triangle
  - Calculate the vectors between the point and the three points of the triangle
  - Calculate the cross product of the vectors of the sides of the triangle and the vectors between the point and the three points of the triangle
  - If the cross product of the three vectors is the same sign, the point is inside the triangle.

Materia (ãƒžãƒ†ãƒªã‚¢) is a recurring term and set of items in the Final Fantasy series that is typically associated with stat boosts and abilities, or in some cases, is used as a plot device. Materia is typically crafted into the equipment of the users, and used for boosting their performance. It originates from Final Fantasy VII.
