## Description

### History

- C was developed in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Telephone laboratories.
- C++ (pronounced ‚Äúsee plus plus‚Äù) was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs as an extension to C, starting in 1979. C++‚Äôs claim to fame results primarily from the fact that it is an object-oriented language.

### Usage

C++ excels in situations where high performance and precise control over memory and other resources is needed. Here are a few common types of applications that most likely would be written in C++:
-  Video games
-  Real-time systems (e.g. for transportation, manufacturing, etc‚Ä¶)
-  High-performance financial applications (e.g. high frequency trading)
-  Graphical applications and simulations
-  Productivity / office applications
-  Embedded software
-  Audio and video processing
-  Artificial intelligence and neural networks

#### Compiler extensions

The C++ language is standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), and the standard is called the C++ Standard. However, many compilers provide extensions that go beyond the standard. These extensions can be useful, but they can also make your code less portable.

- To prevent the use of compiler-specific extensions, you can use the `-pedantic` flag when compiling your code. This flag tells the compiler to strictly adhere to the C++ Standard and to issue warnings when non-standard extensions are used.

```shell
g++ -pedantic -o myProgram myProgram.cpp
```

or
  
```shell
g++ -pedantic-errors -o myProgram myProgram.cpp
```

#### Warning flags

- `-Wall` flag: This flag tells the compiler to enable most warning messages.
- `-Wextra` flag: This flag tells the compiler to enable some extra warning messages.
- `-Werror` flag: This flag tells the compiler to treat all warnings as errors.
  - It's a good pratice to convert all warnings to errors, so that the code will not compile if there are any warnings.

```shell
g++ -Wall -Wextra -Werror -o myProgram myProgram.cpp
```

#### Standard flags

- `-std=value` flag: This flag tells the compiler to use the specified version of the C++ Standard.
  - Example:
  ```shell
  g++ -std=c++17 -o myProgram myProgram.cpp
  ```

### Building

Building:

Because there are multiple steps involved, the term **building** is often used to refer to the full process of **converting source code files into an executable** that can be run. A specific executable produced as the result of building is sometimes called a **build**.

Command line:

```bash
g++ -o myProgram myProgram.cpp
```

#### Building configurations

- **Debug build**: This build is used during development. It includes debugging symbols and is not optimized. This build is typically slower and larger than a release build.
  - `-g` flag: This flag tells the compiler to include debugging information in the executable.
  - `-gdb` flag: This flag tells the compiler to include debugging information that is compatible with the GNU debugger (gdb).
  - `-O0` flag: This flag tells the compiler not to optimize the code.
  - Example:
  ```shell
  g++ -g -gdb -O0 -o myProgram myProgram.cpp
  ```
  or
  ```shell
  g++ -ggdb -o myProgram myProgram.cpp
  ```

- **Release build**: This build is used for distribution. It is optimized for speed and size, and does not include debugging symbols. This build is typically faster and smaller than a debug build.
  - `-O2` flag: This flag tells the compiler to optimize the code for speed.
  - `-DNDEBUG` flag: This flag tells the compiler to define the `NDEBUG` preprocessor macro, which can be used to conditionally compile code.
  - Example:
  ```shell
  g++ -O2 -DNDEBUG -o myProgram myProgram.cpp
  ```

## Introduction

- `statements`: A statement is a single line of code that performs a specific action. For example, `std::cout << "Hello, world!" << std::endl;` is a statement that outputs the text "Hello, world!" to the console.

- `expressions`: An expression is a combination of literals, variables, operators, and function calls that evaluates to a single value. For example, `2 + 3` is an expression that evaluates to `5`.

- `functions`: A function is a block of code that performs a specific task. Functions are used to organize code into manageable pieces, and to facilitate code reuse. For example, `std::cout << "Hello, world!" << std::endl;` is a function call that outputs the text "Hello, world!" to the console.

- `libraries`: A library is a collection of precompiled functions that can be used in your program. Libraries are used to provide functionality that is not built into the language itself. For example, the `iostream` library provides functionality for input and output.

### Comments

- Single-line comments: `//`
- Multi-line comments: `/* */`

### Objects and Variables

```mermaid

classDef RAM fill:#bb56f6;
classDef object fill:#4fc4ff;
classDef variable fill:#f6de56;
  RAM["RAM"]:::RAM
  subgraph RAM
    object:::object
    subgraph object["Object / Memory Region"]
      variable:::variable
      subgraph variable["Variable"]
        name["Name"]
        type["Type"]
        value["Value"]
      end
    end
    object2:::object
    object3:::object
    object4:::object
  end
```

- `object`: An object is a region of memory with a type that stores a value. For example, `int x = 5;` creates an object named `x` that stores the value `5`.

- `variable`: A variable is a named object. For example, `int x = 5;` creates a variable named `x` that stores the value `5`.
  - `variable instantiation`: The process of creating a variable is called variable instantiation.
    - `declaration`: The process of introducing a new name in the program.
      ```cpp
      int x; // declares a variable named x of type int
      ```
      - multiple declarations can be done in a single line.
      ```cpp
      int x, y, z; // declares three variables named x, y, and z of type int
      ```
    - `definition`: The process of allocating storage for a variable and possibly initializing it.
      - assignement operator `=` is used to initialize a variable.
      ```cpp
      int x = 5; // defines a variable named x of type int and initializes it with the value 5
      ```
    - `initialization`: The process of giving a variable an initial value.

      | Initialization | Description |
      |----------------|-------------|
      | `int a;` | Default initialization (for built-in types, this means uninitialized) |
      | `int a = 5;` | Copy initialization |
      | `int a( 5 );` | Direct initialization |
      | `int a{ 5 };` | Direct list initialization (since C++11) |
      | `int a = { 5 };` | Copy list initialization (since C++11) |
      | `int a{};` | Value initialization (since C++11, `a` is initialized to `0`) |

  - `instance`: A variable that has been defined and initialized is called an instance of a variable.
  - `data type`: The type of data that a variable can store is called its data type.

### [IoStream](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/introduction-to-iostream-cout-cin-and-endl/)

Includes:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
```

The `iostream` library provides functionality for input and output. It contains two main classes: `std::istream` and `std::ostream`.

#### STD::COUT

`cout` means "character output". It is an object of the `ostream` class that represents the standard output stream. It is used to output data to the console.
  - It buffers the output, which means that the output is not immediately written to the console. Instead, it is stored in a **buffer** until the buffer is full or until the buffer is flushed.

```cpp
std::cout << "Hello, ";
std::cout << "world!";
// Output: Hello, world!
```

- `<<`: The `<<` operator is used to insert data into the output stream.
  - It is called the **insertion operator**.
  - It can be used multiple times in a single statement to insert multiple pieces of data into the output stream.

- `std::cerr`: The `std::cerr` object is an instance of the `std::ostream` class that is used for writing error messages to the console.
- `std::clog`: The `std::clog` object is an instance of the `std::ostream` class that is used for writing log messages to the console.

#### STD::ENDL

`endl` means "end line". It is a special value that represents a newline character. It is used to insert a newline character into the output stream and flush the stream.
  - It is equivalent to `'\n'` followed by `std::flush`.
    - `std::flush`: The `std::flush` manipulator is used to flush the output stream, which means that any buffered output is written to the console.
    - **best practice is to use `\n` instead of `std::endl`** to insert a newline character into the output stream, because `std::endl` flushes the stream, which can be inefficient (It‚Äôs more efficient to let the system flush itself periodically (which it has been designed to do efficiently)). As a result, **`std::endl` should only be used when you need to flush the stream**.
  - It is called a manipulator because it modifies the behavior of the output stream.

```cpp
std::cout << "Hello, " << std::endl;
std::cout << "world!";
// Output: Hello,
//         world!
```

#### STD::CIN

`cin` means "character input". It is an object of the `istream` class that represents the standard input stream. It is used to read data from the console.
  - `>>`: The `>>` operator is used to extract data from the input stream.
    - It is called the **extraction operator**.
    - It can be used multiple times in a single statement to extract multiple pieces of data from the input stream.

```cpp
int x{};
std::cin >> x;
std::cout << "You entered: " << x;
// Output: You entered: [value of x]
```
