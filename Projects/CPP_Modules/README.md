## Description

### History

- C was developed in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Telephone laboratories.
- C++ (pronounced ‚Äúsee plus plus‚Äù) was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs as an extension to C, starting in 1979. C++‚Äôs claim to fame results primarily from the fact that it is an object-oriented language.

### Usage

C++ excels in situations where high performance and precise control over memory and other resources is needed. Here are a few common types of applications that most likely would be written in C++:
-  Video games
-  Real-time systems (e.g. for transportation, manufacturing, etc‚Ä¶)
-  High-performance financial applications (e.g. high frequency trading)
-  Graphical applications and simulations
-  Productivity / office applications
-  Embedded software
-  Audio and video processing
-  Artificial intelligence and neural networks

### Compilation / Linking
Compiling:

Linking:

Building:

Because there are multiple steps involved, the term **building** is often used to refer to the full process of **converting source code files into an executable** that can be run. A specific executable produced as the result of building is sometimes called a **build**.

Command line:

```bash
g++ -o myProgram myProgram.cpp
```
