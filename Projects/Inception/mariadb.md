MariaDB is a community-developed fork of the MySQL relational database management system intended to remain free under the GNU GPL. Being a fork of a leading open source software system, it is notable for being led by the original developers of MySQL, who forked it due to concerns over its acquisition by Oracle.

## Setup

### Installation

üßë‚Äçüéì [Guide Setup - DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-mariadb-on-ubuntu-20-04)

#### Ubuntu/Debian

```bash
apt-get install mariadb-server
```

### Configuration

#### Configuration File

‚öôÔ∏è [MariaDB Configuration File](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/configuring-mariadb-with-option-files/) : The configuration file is where the MariaDB server reads its settings.

üóÉÔ∏è [List of options of the Config File](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/9.0/en/server-option-variable-reference.html)

Location depends on the system, but it is usually located at `/etc/mysql/my.cnf`. For MariaDB server, the configuration file is `/etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/50-server.cnf`.

##### Configuration Options

- `datadir` : The directory where MariaDB stores its data.
- `pid-file` : The file where the server writes the process ID.
- `socket` : The Unix socket file that the server uses for communication with local clients.
- `user` : The MariaDB user that the server runs as.
- `port` : The port number on which the server listens for TCP/IP connections.
- `bind-address` : The IP address to bind to.

##### Example

```ini
[mysqld]
datadir=/var/lib/mysql
socket=/run/mysql/mysql.sock
pid-file=/run/mysql/mysql.pid
user=root
port=3306 # Default port
bind-address= 0.0.0.0 # Listen to all interfaces
```

#### Configuration of Database

Setup the database with user and password.

```sql
-- Create database
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS <database>;
-- Create user and grant privileges
CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS '<user>'@'<host>' IDENTIFIED BY '<password>';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON <database>.* TO '<user>'@'<host>' IDENTIFIED BY '<password>';
-- Change password of a user
ALTER USER '<root_user>'@'<host>' IDENTIFIED BY '<root_password>';
-- Flush privileges
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

### Usage

<details>
<summary><h4>Command to Access Database</h4></summary>

```bash
docker exec -it <container> mysql -u <user> -p <database>
```

or

```bash
mysql -u <user> -p <database>
```

Exit the database with `exit` command.
