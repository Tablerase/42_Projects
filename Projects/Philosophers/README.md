- Each philosopher should be a thread.
- Each philosopher has one fork.
- To eat, a philosopher needs to have two forks.
- Prevent philosophers from duplicating forks, protect the forks state
with a mutex for each of them.
- They should avoid dying.

## Functions

- `memset`: Sets a block of memory with a specified value. Used in C and C++.

- `printf`: Outputs formatted text to the console. Used in C and C++.

- `malloc`: Allocates a block of memory and returns a pointer to it. Used in C and C++.

- `free`: Deallocates a block of memory that was previously allocated by `malloc`, `calloc`, or `realloc`. Used in C and C++.

- `write`: Writes data from a buffer into a file or a file descriptor. Used in C and C++.

- `usleep`: Suspends execution of the calling thread for (at least) the number of microseconds specified. Used in Unix-like operating systems.

- `gettimeofday`: Gets the current time. Used in Unix-like operating systems.

- `pthread_create`: Creates a new thread. Used in POSIX threads (pthreads).

- `pthread_detach`: Marks a thread for deletion when it finishes execution. Used in pthreads.

- `pthread_join`: Suspends execution of the calling thread until the target thread finishes execution. Used in pthreads.

- `pthread_mutex_init`: Initializes a mutex. Used in pthreads.

- `pthread_mutex_destroy`: Destroys a mutex. Used in pthreads.

- `pthread_mutex_lock`: Locks a mutex. Used in pthreads.

- `pthread_mutex_unlock`: Unlocks a mutex. Used in pthreads.

### usleep

```c
#include <unistd.h>

int usleep(useconds_t usec);
```

- Suspends execution of the calling thread for (at least) the number of microseconds specified.

Parameters:

- `usec`: The number of microseconds to suspend execution.
  - `useconds_t` is an unsigned integer type.

Return value:

- On success, `usleep` returns 0.
- On error, it returns -1.

<summary>Example</summary>

```c
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello\n");
    usleep(1000000);  // Sleep for 1 second
    printf("World\n");

    return 0;
}
```
